Collection of methods to supply the initial seeds. For most methods that
take input files, we define one method
    get_recids_from_[....]_file(path, db),
which may or may not require the db argument,
then define
    get_recids_from_[....]_paths(paths, db)
which may or may not require the db argument, and loops over a list of files
or directories.
The fact that all of the functions can take the db argument (even if they
don't need it) is to make wrapping via
    get_recids_from_paths
easier.
