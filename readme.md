# InspiderWeb [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klieret/inspiderweb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klieret/inspiderweb)
[Features](#features) | [Screenshots](#screenshots) | [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work) | [Limitations/Bugs](#limitationsbugs) | [Installation](#installation) | [Usage](#usage) | [Tutorial](#tutorial) | [Usage Examples](#examples-usage) | [License](#license)

InspiderWeb is a tool to analyze networks papers referencing and citing each other. It gets its information from the [inspirehep](http://inspirehep.net/) API, then uses the [dot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) to describe the network. The result can then be plotted by the [Graphviz Package](http://www.graphviz.org/) and similar programs.

**Note: This Script was using webcraling & regex-html parsing (yes, that's evil) to extract information from inspiderweb and just recently switched to using the API. If something doesn't work, check out the ```webcrawling_legacy``` branch.**

## Features

* Clickable nodes which open the paper in inspirehep! For this to work, do not use the ```-Tpdf``` option (as it uses cairo which does not support hyperlinks). Instead do ```dot -Tps2 dotfile.dot > tmp.ps && ps2pdf tmp.ps output.pdf```.  
* Sort papers by year!

## Screenshots

## How does it work?

Starting from some initial records ("seeds"), inspiderweb uses the inspirehep API to get references citations and other information. This information is then analyzed and used to generate an output in the [dot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)), describing the connections between (a subset of) the papers considered. This output can then be used by tools like ```dot```, ```fdp```, ```sfdp``` (provided by the [Graphviz Package](http://www.graphviz.org/)) to render the Graph as a ```.png```, ```.pdf``` and many more. 

## Limitations/Bugs

* I didn't do too many tests and there's maybe more todo notes in the code than features itself, so don't expect everything to work right away!
* Downloading the references/citations of a large number of papers will take its time. The script waits a few seconds after each download as to not strain the inspirehep capacities, so just let in run in the background for a couple of hours and it should be done. As a rough estimate, it's one download per 25 references/citations per paper, so about 4s per 25 references per paper. 
* Right now all the downloaded information is saved as a python3 [pickle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) of ```Record``` objects. This clearly is the easiest choice, but definitely not the best one for bigger database scales. If anyone wants to implement this more elegantly or provide export possibilities to other database format, this is very welcome.


## Installation

1. Clone this archive via 
        
        git clone https://github.com/klieret/inspiderweb
    
    or download the current version as a ```.zip``` by clicking [here](https://github.com/klieret/inspiderweb/archive/master.zip). 
    I assume you already have ```pythone3``` installed. 
    As for python >= 3.5 it only uses the standard python libraries, for earlier version, you need to install the ```typing``` package, e.g. run
    
        sudo pip3 install typing

2. Install graphviz. On most Linux systems this should already be in the repository, so

        sudo apt-get install graphviz

    or similar should do the job.
    
3. If you need to generate pdfs with clickable hyperlinks, you need the ```ps2pdf``` utility. E.g. run

        sudo apt-get install ps2pdf

## Intro/Usage

Some terms which are used in the following:

* ```record```: Record on inspirehep, representing a paper or a similar resource. Also the ```Record``` class, which is used to represent one record in inspiderweb.
* ```recid```: The record id of a record, e.g. ```1472971``` for the the record at http://inspirehep.net/record/1472971/
* ```bibkey```: The bibtex label provided by inspirehep, e.g. ```Davies:2016ruz``` for the above record (as can be checked in the bibtex output at http://inspirehep.net/record/1472971/export/hx)
* ```seed```: Basically initial records that inspiderweb uses as starting point by downloading their references/citations etc. 
* ```database```: Inspiderweb caches all the downloaded information here. Basically a collection of ```Records``` together with some useful methods.

Usually there are two steps involved to get the graph:

1. Run ```inspiderweb```
2. Use the ```graphviz``` package to plot a nice graph.

The ```graphviz``` package provides several nice tools that can be used.

* ```dot```: For "Hierarchical" graphcs: ```dot -Tpdf dotfile.dot > dotfile.pdf``` (to generate pdf output). This will be the most relevant command, especially for huge graphs.
* ```fdp```: For "Spring models": ```dfp -Tpdf dotfile.dot > dotfile.pdf``` (to generate pdf output) 
* ```sfdp```: Like ```fdp``` but scales better with bigger networks: ```dfp -Tpdf dotfile.dot > dotfile.pdf``` (to generate pdf output)

All command line options of inspiderweb are described in the help message: Run ```python3 inspiderweb.py --help``` to get:

Setup/Configure Options:
  Supply in/output paths. Note that in most cases, seeds are only added to the database if we perform some action.

  -d DATABASE [DATABASE ...], --database DATABASE [DATABASE ...]
                        Pickle database (db) file. Multiple db files are
                        supported. In this case the first one will be used to
                        save the resulting merged db
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output dot file.
  -r RECIDPATHS [RECIDPATHS ...], --recidpaths RECIDPATHS [RECIDPATHS ...]
                        Path of a file or a directory. Multiple pathsare
                        supported. If the path points to a file, each line of
                        the file is interpreted as a recid. The collected
                        recidsare then used as seeds. If thepath points to a
                        directory, we recursivelygo into it (excluding hidden
                        files) and extract recids from every file.
  -q QUERIES [QUERIES ...], --queries QUERIES [QUERIES ...]
                        Take the results of inspirehep search query (search
                        string you would enter in the inspirehep online search
                        form) as seeds. Multiple search strings supported.
  -b BIBKEYPATHS [BIBKEYPATHS ...], --bibkeypaths BIBKEYPATHS [BIBKEYPATHS ...]
                        Path of a file or a directory. Multiple paths are
                        supported. If the path points to a file, the file is
                        searched for bibkeys, which are then used as seeds. If
                        thepath points to a directory, we recursivelygo into
                        it (excluding hidden files) and search every file for
                        bibkeys.
  -u URLPATHS [URLPATHS ...], --urlpaths URLPATHS [URLPATHS ...]
                        Path of a file or a directory. If the path points to a
                        file, the file is searched for inspirehep urls, from
                        which the recids are extracted and used as seeds. If
                        thepath points to a directory, we recursivelygo into
                        it (excluding hidden files) and search every file for
                        bibkeys.

Action Options:
  What do you want to do?

  -p [PLOT [PLOT ...]], --plot [PLOT [PLOT ...]]
                        Generate dot output (i.e. plot). If you do not specify
                        an option, only connections between seeds are plotted
                        (this is thesame as specifying 'seeds>seeds' or 's>s'.
                        If you want to customize this, you can supply several
                        rules of the following form: 'source
                        selection'>'target selection'. The selectionsfor
                        source targets are of the form {seeds,all}[.{refs,
                        cites,refscites}]. Where e.g. seeds.refscites means
                        that all recordsbeing cited by a seed or citing a seed
                        are valid starting pointsof an arrow. Short options: s
                        (seeds), a (all), r (refs), c (cites). For
                        'refscites', the following alias exist: 'citesrefs',
                        'cr', 'rc'.
  -g GET [GET ...], --get GET [GET ...]
                        Download information. Multiple arguments are
                        supported. Each argument must look like this: Starts
                        with 'seeds' or 'all' (depending on whether every db
                        entry or just the seeds will be taken as starting
                        point). Just 'seeds' (short 's') or 'all' (short 'a')
                        will only download the bibliographic information for
                        every item. Furthermore, there are the following
                        options: (1) 'refs' (short 'r'): References of each
                        recid (2) 'cites' (short 'c'): Citations of each recid
                        (3) 'refscites' or 'citesrefs' (short 'rc' or 'cr'):
                        both. These options can be chained, e.g.
                        seeds.refs.cites means 1. For each seed recid, get all
                        reference 2. For all of the above, get all citations.
                        Similarly one could have written 's.r.c'.

## Tutorial

### Basics

In the following I will always give two lines, the second with the shortcut options, the first one with the longer (and easier to understand options). Instead of ```python3 inspiderweb.py```, you can also use ```python3 inspiderweb.py``` linux (after setting the ```x``` privilege). Note that paths that contain spaces must be enclosed in quotation marks.

Displaying the help:

    python3 inspiderweb.py --help
    python3 inspiderweb.py --h
    
Printing statistics about our database (will always be printed if we run the program). It will only be created, so it will look pretty bleak. Of course you can supply your own name for the database, here it's ```test.pickle``` (in the ```db``` folder).

    python3 inspiderweb.py --database db/test.pickle
    python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/test.pickle

Output:

    WARNING: Could not load db from file.
    INFO: ************** DATABASE STATISTICS ***************
    INFO: Current number of records: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with references: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with citations: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with cocitations: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with bibkey: 0
    INFO: **************************************************

### Specifying seeds & Downloading information

Add a few seeds (the ids of inspirehep, i.e. the number ```811388``` from ```http://inspirehep.net/record/811388/```) and download the bibinfo and the references. For this we use the example file in ```seeds/example_small.txt```.

    python3 inspiderweb.py --database db/test.pickle --recidpaths seeds/example_small.txt --get seed.citesrefs
    python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/test.pickle -r seeds/example_small.txt g s.cr
   
This can take some time (around a minute, mainly because the script waits quite often to not overload the inspirehep server), while we see output like: 

    INFO: Read 11 seeds from file seeds/example_small.txt.
    DEBUG: Successfully saved db to db/test.pickle
    DEBUG: Downloading bibfile of 1125962
    DEBUG: Downloading from http://inspirehep.net/record/1125962/export/hx.
    DEBUG: Download successfull. Sleeping for 3s.
    DEBUG: Bibkey of 1125962 is Chatrchyan:2012gqa
    DEBUG: Downloading references of 1125962
    DEBUG: Downloading from http://inspirehep.net/record/1125962/references.
    DEBUG: Download successfull. Sleeping for 3s.
    DEBUG: 1125962 is citing 44 records
    ...

Afterwards, if we run the statistics again, we could see that we were successfull:

    INFO: ************** DATABASE STATISTICS ***************
    INFO: Current number of records: 618
    INFO: Current number of records with references: 11
    INFO: Current number of records with citations: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with cocitations: 0
    INFO: Current number of records with bibkey: 618
    INFO: **************************************************

### Plotting

Now we are ready to plot the relations between these nodes:

    python3 inspiderweb.py --database db/test.pickle --plot --recidpaths seeds/example_small.txt --output build/test.dot
    python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/test.pickle -p -r seeds/example_small.txt -o build/test.dot

This will produce the file ```build/test.dot``` (I chose to place all of the output files in the ```build``` repository as to not make the repository dirty):

    digraph g {
        
        // Formatting of the whole Graph
    
        graph [label="inspiderweb 2017-06-04 16:02:09.361469", fontsize=40];
        node[fontsize=20, fontcolor=black, fontname=Arial, style=filled, color=green];	
        
        // Adding nodes (optional, but we want to have specific labels)
        
        "591241" [label="Sullivan:2002jt" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/591241"];
        "855936" [label="delAguila:2010mx" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/855936"];
        "1111995" [label="Chatrchyan:2012meb" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/1111995"];
        "279185" [label="Altarelli:1989ff" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/279185"];
        "1125962" [label="Chatrchyan:2012gqa" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/1125962"];
        "892770" [label="Grojean:2011vu" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/892770"];
        "1322383" [label="Aad:2014xea" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/1322383"];
        "677093" [label="Schmaltz:2005ky" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/677093"];
        "1204603" [label="Han:2012vk" URL="http://inspirehep.net/record/1204603"];
        
        // Connections
	
        "1204603" -> "1111995"; 
        "1111995" -> "279185"; 
        "1125962" -> "1111995"; 
        "1125962" -> "591241"; 
        "1322383" -> "591241"; 
        "892770" -> "591241"; 
        "1322383" -> "1125962"; 
        "1125962" -> "677093"; 
        "892770" -> "855936"; 
        "1204603" -> "892770"; 
    }%                               

Note that we could also have done all of the above with just one command:

    python3 inspiderweb.py --database db/test.pickle --plot --recidpaths seeds/example_small.txt --get bib refs --output build/test.dot
    python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/test.pickle -p -r seeds/example_small.txt -u bib refs -o build/test.dot

Note that running this should (basically) run straight through, without downloading anything, as all the information was saved in the database: This gives output like

    ...
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    DEBUG: Successfully saved db to db/test.pickle
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of info.
    DEBUG: Skipping downloading of references.
    ...

Now we are ready to use ```dot``` to plot this! The most basic command for ```.pdf``` output is:

    dot -Tpdf build/test.dot > build/test.pdf 

which gives us the following picture: 

![tutorial first picture](https://github.com/klieret/readme-files/blob/master/inspiderweb/tutorial.png)

To get ```.pdf``` output with clickable nodes, we cannot use ```-Tpdf``` however, but instead first have to generate a ```.ps``` which we then convert via the ```ps2pdf``` utility:

    dot -Tps2 build/test.dot > test.ps && ps2pdf build/test.ps build/test.pdf 

To get the graph sorted by years, simply supply the ```--rank year``` option. Doing all of this in one line (connecting different commands with ```&&```):

    python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/test.pickle -p --rank year -r seeds/example_small.txt -o build/test.dot && dot -Tps2 build/test.dot > build/test.ps && ps2pdf build/test.ps build/test.pdf

## Usage Examples

See the tutorial for how to plot the dotfile. 

* Get all references for one paper and plot their relations: Look up the paper on inspirehep and get the recid from the url, then run
    
        python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/<db name>.pickle -q "refersto:recid:<RECID>" -g seeds.refs -p -o build/<output name>.dot 
  
* I have a couple of documents in a folder that contain inspirehep bibkeys. I want to plot all the connections between these papers. 

        python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/<db name>.pickle -b <path to folder> -g seeds.refscites -p -o build/<output name>.dot

  If you instead only have a couple of documents, simply do ```-p <path1> <path2> ...```.
  
* I want to get the relations between all of the papers I authored:

        python3 inspiderweb.py -d db/<db name>.pickle -q "a <authorname>" -g seeds.refs -p -o build/<output name>.dot     

Mostly works like this:

    db = Database(args.database[0])
    db.load()
    recids = ....
    db.autocomplete_records(..., ...)
    dg = DotGraph(db)
    
    def valid_connection(source, target):
        .... 
    
    for recid, record in db._records.items():
            for referece_recid in record.references:
                if not valid_connection(record.recid, referece_recid):
                    continue
                dg.add_connection(record.recid, referece_recid)
            for citation_recid in record.citations:
                if not valid_connection(record.recid, citation_recid):
                    continue
                dg.add_connection(citation_recid, record.recid)
    
    dg.generate_dot_str(rank=args.rank)
    dg.write_to_file(args.output)
    
    db.save()
